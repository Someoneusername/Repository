## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use: 
- Ctrl-C (copy)
- Ctrl-V (paste)
- Ctrl-Z (undo)
- Window-Print (screenshot)
- Alt-Tab (switch tab/window)
- Window-Tab (view all tabs)

Shortcuts I would like to start using: 
- Ctrl-A (select all)
- Win-D (show desktop)
- Super-Hyper-Meta-F (I donâ€™t even have such keys, but it sounds impressive)
- Window/F11-Up arrow (maximize window)
- Window-D (hide and display the desktop)
- Window-L (lock PC)
